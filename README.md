The goal of this project was to be able to visualize my team's racing data. There has always been talk on the team that we peak too early in the season and therefore do not do well at the end. I wanted to see if this was the case.

This was my first major programming project and while it does not seem like much I was also still getting used to python. Along with this selenium did take some time to get used to since there are only specific ways you can access elements it did take some time getting used to. On to the graphing part, I had some trouble converting the dates and times to datetime objects, but eventually that was fixed. I also had to come up with creative solutions to graphing all the averages on the same plot since they would have different years. Something I could not figure out which I think I could if I have more time, is box plots. I feel like some of the larger data would be better represented as boxplots but it seems that matplotlib does not work well with making boxplots from datetime objects. Another feature I wanted to implement to the graphs would make the data more streamlined and delete the large gaps between data, but this was also hard to figure out and there does not seem to and an easy solution.
